Hi!

My name is Ciara and I am a final year Publishing Student as Oxford Brookes University. 

I have created this blog to maintain and grow my writing skills and using this space as a place to freely express my thoughts and opinions! 

I would describe myself as a huge vegan food enthusiast and have been vegan for almost 3 years now. It has really changed my perspective on cooking, animal rights, environmental issues and digestive health, which I will be sharing more about on this site!
