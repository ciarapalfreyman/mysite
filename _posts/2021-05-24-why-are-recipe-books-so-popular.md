Cookery books may seem like a product that is dying out in the book market given the instantaneous accessibility of searching up the  most simple ham and cheese toast to the most bizarre and obscure like sea urchin guacamole tacos. So considering digital disruption has provided us with almost limitless recipes to fill our hearts (and mouths) desire, its surprising to see cookery books coming out top in the market; with Nielsen Book Scan data showing an 8.2% increase in sales in 2020. 



Perhaps theres something nostalgic about cookery books that keeps readers buying them. the thought that the authors have thoughtfully crafted each recipes with such care and precision, all complied into one book which takes a special place in peoples homes. the stories about the authors history, heritage and culture that adds a pinch of authenticity, which makes the reader feel as if they’re actually in Bologna, cooking the perfect Tagliatelle Bolognese. But then again, cookery blogs can have just the same authentic feel can’t they? Just because you're reading it through a laptop or tablet screen surely doesn't significantly change the readers experience? So I’m still curious as to why we are still choosing to spend our money on recipes which we can get for free at just a few clicks away?



Acting upon my curiosity, i delved into research and found some interesting takes about cooker books which I had not cared to consider. Rachel Cooke (2010) from The Guardian makes an interesting point that there is book to cookery books than just the recipes. Recipe books are often collected by book buyers, the become a token to be displaced on their bookshelf in the kitchen, often giving off the wanting impression that you cook more than you do. on the other hand, vintage cook books are also particularly attractive, they are seen as to be something to be treasured and there is something about following a recipe from a particular time that gives it sense of uniqueness and nostalgia. 



Above all else, cookery books can say a lot about a person; food after all is a large part of our identity. when someone steps into our home, looking a what kind of food they enjoy, you can get a sense of who they are; how adventurous, cultured, well travelled. perhaps this more psychological perspective on why are continue to purchase cook books is what is keeping recipe book sales thriving?
