In 2013, Penguin Classics released Orwell’s haunting and timeless classic Nineteen Eighty Four with an unusual twist on their traditional and distinct classic covers. The cover designed by text and cover designer David Pearson, creates a simple but impactful cover which perceptively plays upon the novel’s key themes and symbolism whilst capturing the reader's curiosity. I have picked this cover because it executes the essence of a complex story with intriguing simplicity. In this post, I explore the design styles and the significance of the symbolism behind them in relation to the text. 

The first thing that catches the eye on this cover is the contrast between the traditional Penguin Classics style. The cover maintains a clear and simple layout but is juxtaposed with the black smear over the title, conjuring a sense of elusiveness. Although the title is not immediately visible, it has been debossed and can be detected through touch. Arguably this could have been a commercial risk with regards to audience reception but nonetheless due to the global resonance this novel has, this is not an issue. 

Additionally, this unique styling chosen by Pearson is a clever response to Orwell’s own experience of censorship, and is still currently banned in countries such as China. In relation to the novel, the covering of the covering of the title alludes to the symbolism of the public being blind and stripped of independent thought as a result of a totalitarian regime; in particular alluding to the Ministry of Truth, responsible for rewriting history and monitoring all arts, media and entertainment. According to Creative Review, Pearson explains that the title and author were debossed, completely covered by black foiling just leaving “enough for the title and authors name to be determined”. It furthermore uses texture to invite the reader to become intrigued by using different senses to explore the cover.
