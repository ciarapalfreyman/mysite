When it comes to typefaces, it is important to understand the nuances of their classification. We see different typefaces in our everyday lives whether we’re surfing the web, reading a newspaper, on adverts and even when making daily purchases at our favourite shops. Typographic design is essential to brand identity and in recent years is determining its commercial success. 



The five basic classifications of typefaces: serif, sans serif, monospaced, script and display. You are probably familiar with serif and san serif as these are the most recognisable, usually used for either headlines or body text. Script and display are typically used just for headlines, whilst monospaced is used for code but originated from typewriters. 



There has been an interesting evolution with typefaces. Calligraphic and Blackletter were the earliest typefaces to be used, which transitioned to serif. Following on from serif is sans serif which is where more contemporary fonts came into fruition, as seen in most modern design. Finally, most recently we have pixel and decorative. Pixel is based off computer design and uses its style based off onscreen display of pixels. Decorative often have a 3D element to their design, usually used for billboards, posters and headlines.
